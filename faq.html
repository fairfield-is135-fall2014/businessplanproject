 <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2> 
<p><h3>How can I be sure that what I post on the website is going to be protected from cheaters and criminals?</h3></p> <br> 
<p>We will do whatever we can can to protect your privacy and intellectual property. All access to your information is granted on a 'need to know' basis: </p> <br> 

<p> 1. Only registered users can read anything about students or teams. We might mention your name in an article or picture caption if you win a contest, but access to 
your profile and team pages is off limits to the general public.</p><br>
<p> 2. While we offer our help to connect you with professionals to work with you on your business plans, we do not give them access to your documents. That is up to you. </p> <br> 
<p> 3. Competitors and mentors can only view & download their own teams' documents. Any other information posted on the team pages (e.g., basic concept, team roster, etc.) 
is kept general enough so as to not provide any unfair competitive advantage.</p><br>
<p> 4. Organizers and judges can access your documents, but they are bound by the competition rules not to share anything without your permission. </p> <br> 
<p> 5. If you suspect that there is a problem with someone gaining access to your private information, then please contact Chris Huntley at chuntley@fairfield.edu to report it.</p> <br> 

<p><h3>Something important got chopped off in my photo. What happened?</h3></p> <br>
<p>All photos uploaded to the website are resized and cropped to fit into the page template. When cropping is required, the middle part of the picture is retained, with the edges chopped
 off as needed. If the result displeases you, then you can pre-crop your photos to fit the template. Pixler does a great job of doing such things and is 100% free to use. </p> <br>  

<p><h3>My photo looks awful/unprofessional. How can I replace it with a new one?</h3><p> <br>
<p>Chances are, your photo was imported from LinkedIn, Google+, or Facebook when you created your account. You can always replace your photo as follows:</p> <br> 

<p>1. Log in and click the 'My Account' link at the top of the page.</p> <br>
<p>2. Click the 'Edit' tab to edit your account information.</p> <br>
<p>3. Click the 'Delete picture' checkbox.</p> <br>
<p>4. Upload a new photo. For best results, the photo should be square, with your head taking up most of the space. The photo will be automatically resized and cropped to 180x180 
pixels (about 2 inches on a side). If the photo is not square, then the top/bottom or left/right edges will be cropped off to make it square. </p> <br> 

<p><h3>How can I show social icons (Facebook, ...) on my profile?</h3></p> <br>
<p>Two things are required:</p> <br>

<p>1. You must have an identity (social login) for any service you want linked. Instructions for that are given in another FAQ. </p> <br> 
<p>You must enable them in the Social Links section of your account settings. Don't forget to hit the save button after enabling the Social Links.</p> <br>

<p><h3>How can I add a social login (Facebook, Google+, or LinkedIn) to my existing account?</h3></p> <br> 
<p>Thanks for asking. We really don't like it when people create redundant accounts just because they want to stop using their username/password. Instead, just add a new 
Identity (i.e., social network account link) to your account. </p> <br>

<p>It's pretty easy to add an Identity:</p> <br> 

<p>1. Login however you usually log in. </p> <br>
<p>2. Click on the 'My Account' link at the top of the page. </p> <br> 
<p>3. Click the 'Hybridauth' tab to edit your social identities. </p> <br> 
<p>4. Click on one of the services listed at the bottom of the page (LinkedIn, ...) to add the identity to your account. You may have to log in at the service before coming 
back to our site. Note: only you can do that; even the system administrators can't do it for you.</p> <br>
<p>5. Once your identity has been added you can use it to log in the next time you visit the site. </p> <br> 

<p><h3>How can I update my Major or Publicity Bio? I don't see them in my account settings.</h3></p> <br>
<p>Because of the diversity of people involved in the competition, not every profile field applies to every person. Role-specific profile data (e.g., major for students, short bio 
for volunteers) is entered on a separate tab within your account settings page. </p> <br> 

<p>1. Go to your account settings page (if you aren't there already) by clicking on the My Account link. </p> <br> 
<p>2. Click the Edit tab.</p> <br> 
<p>3. If you are a student, then click on the Competitor Profile button. Otherwise, click on the Public Bio Page button. You will see a different button depending on your role. </p> <br> 
<p>4. Edit your profile and save. </p> <br>
