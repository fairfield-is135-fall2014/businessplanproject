    <h2>Rules & Policies</h2>

<p>The business plan competition is a fairly complex enterprise, with plenty of interconnections 
between competitors, mentors, organizers, and judges. This section of the Competitors Guide 
describes the rules under which we will operate the competition. It is the first place to look
if you have a question about how things are supposed to work. </p> <br>

<h3>Judging Criteria</h3>

<p>The judges look for ideas that are innovative and can be converted into a viable business venture with 
positive social impact. Criteria include:</p><br> 

<p>Innovation: Does the idea comprise a creative solution to a real problem? If the venture is based 
on a new technology, will the venture retain a sustainable competitive advantage?<br>
Viability: Can the proposed business by launched and implemented successfully? Is the proposed business 
financially viable? Is this demonstrated in the business plan?<br>
Impact: Does the business mission bring about positive social change? (While not strictly required, having 
positive social impact will improve your chances of making the final round in March.)<br>
Organization: How well structured is the plan? Does it provide a thorough description of the proposed
business? Have all contingencies been considered?<br>
Oral presentation: How convincing is the group in selling the plan to judges? Have they exhibited 
effective presentation skills?<br>
More information about ventures can be found in the resources section of the manual. Additionally, 
the Dolan School of Business offers several relevant courses that are open to all Fairfield University 
students, include the Technology Ventures class in the Management department.</p><br>
