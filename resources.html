    <h3>Business Plan Template</h3> 
    
    <p>While there are many different ways to structure a business plan, the following outline covers the essential

      should include each numbered section and Appendix A. However, depending upon the situation, some questions may not
      be relevant at all, while others are absolutely critical. The art is being able to tell the difference. For that 
      we suggest consulting with your mentor. </p>
